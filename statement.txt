* Pair names and student numbers:
     - Khaled Mohammed H Albishre    ,  SN: n8560081
     - Zahran Zahir Mohammed Al-Abri ,  SN: n8964955

* This is to confirm that Khaled and Zahran worked both on this assignment.
     - Khaled: I agree with this contribution.
     - Zahran: I agree with this contribution.

* We used the Github in the middle of the project, that's why the number of comments are not high enough.
  Although, we distributed the work efficiency, so both of us worked as Coder as well as Tester (in seprate classes and unit tests). This will be clear on the @auther in each class.
